# EDA_repo
This repo is for exploratory data analysis functions. 

The exemple data has the following format.
- Normal dist on column normal.
- Categorical in the categorical column, and
- Continuous in the continuous column.

|     normal | categories   |   continuous |
|-----------:|:-------------|-------------:|
|   1.18967  | a            |            1 |
|   0.689035 | b            |            2 |
| nan        | --           |            3 |
|   0.599741 | nan          |            4 |
|  -0.605406 | c            |          nan |
|  -1.09387  | a            |            6 |
| nan        | a            |            7 |
|  -0.768324 | c            |          nan |
|  -0.396219 | a            |            9 |
|  -0.914014 | nan          |           10 |

Notice that we are missing info, and missleading information ('--').

The exemple data set cover at least the following edge cases.
- Normal is missing 2 values, in this case expresed as nan.
- Categories missing 3 values, two of them are nan and the third one "--".
- Continuous is missing 2 values.

The fucntions fill in the Nans or invalid values with the appropiate technique.
The result data set, as follow.

|    normal | categories   |   continuous |
|----------:|:-------------|-------------:|
|  1.18967  | a            |            1 |
|  0.689035 | b            |            2 |
| -0.162422 | a            |            3 |
|  0.599741 | a            |            4 |
| -0.605406 | c            |            5 |
| -1.09387  | a            |            6 |
| -0.162422 | a            |            7 |
| -0.768324 | c            |            8 |
| -0.396219 | a            |            9 |
| -0.914014 | a            |           10 |

Note that the Normal column missing value has been updated to the mean.
The categorical column to the mode, and the continuous value with 
interpolation.

There is also other functions that have been very helpful for me, and I will be adding information as thay change.

Thanks for taking a look, 
Mario.
